                                All 20-year-old Daisy Haites has ever wanted is a normal life, but as the heiress to
                                London's most notorious criminal empire, it's just not on the cards for her.
                            </b>

                            Raised by her older brother
                            <b>Julian </b>
                            since their parents were murdered,
                            <b>Daisy </b>
                            has never been able to escape the watchful gaze of her gang-lord brother. But Julian's line
                            of work means that Daisy's life is... complicated.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And things don't become any easier when she falls hard for the beautiful and emotionally
                            unavailable
                            <b>Christian Hemmes</b>
                            , who also happens to be one of the few men in London who doesn't answer to Julian.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Christian's life is no walk in the park either, since he's in love with his best friend's
                            girlfriend,
                            <b>Magnolia Parks</b>
                            .

                            <br>
                            He's happy enough to use Daisy to throw off the scent of his true affections - until she
                            starts to infiltrate those too.
                            <br>

                            As their romance blossoms into something neither were anticipating, Daisy, Christian, and
                            Julian must come to terms with the fact that in this life everything comes at a price. As
                            their relationships intersect and tangle, they all learn that sometimes life's most
                            worthwhile pursuits can only be paid in blood.
